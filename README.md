This is my own symmetric cipher, written from scratch. I wrote this to test my skills for working with bytes and bits.  
A lot of this project was just meant for learning, it is not meant to be an extremely secure cipher. This should not  
be used to encrypt sensitive data, I am not responsible for the data encrypted using this tool or it's integrity.

# How do I use this?
Simply launch the tool, you will see a console window appear. Once the console window has appeared you may enter the  
message that you wish to encrypt using FoxCipher. After you have entered the message you desire you may now also  
enter the password you wish to use in encrypting this message. Once you have provided a message and a password the  
tool will begin a round trip encryption, encrypting your message and then decrypting your message. You will see your  
encrypted message and decrypted message on the console window.

# Bugs and issues
If you encounter and bugs or issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. I will address these issues as soon as I can.  
If you happen to find any vulnerabilities for this cipher, I would be VERY interested in what they are, and how you went  
about finding them. Do not hesitate to open an issue on Github.
